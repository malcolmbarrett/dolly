dolly is an R package to clone data sets efficiently for use with
G-methods and other causal inference approaches. dolly masks the tedious
bookkeeping of cloning data sets into multiple objects and focuses on
the more interesting and important action of specifying counterfactual
states relevant to the research question. dolly also lets you work with
a single object as you predict multiple counterfactuals.

dolly is under development
